# Overview

Zuora provides a number of REST resources, such as Accounts and Subscriptions. Most of them support several methods. The exceptions are Catalog, which simply returns your Zuora product catalog, and Connections , which logs you in to create a session cookie. In general, our REST API does not duplicate the functions of our SOAP API, but instead supports the basic use-cases needed for a web-based self-service storefront.

You can use the [developer console](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/D_REST_API/A_REST_basics/6_Developer_console) to try these calls and examine the results.
